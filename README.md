## Installation
Djangoplicity Customsearch currently supports Python 2.7 and Python 3+.

You must install Djangoplicity Customsearch using the Github repository, so add the following packages to your
requirements depending on the Python version you are using.
```
# For Python 3+
git+https://@github.com/djangoplicity/djangoplicity.git@release/python3

git+https://@github.com/djangoplicity/djangoplicity-customsearch.git@release/python3

# For Python 2.7
git+https://@github.com/djangoplicity/djangoplicity.git@develop

git+https://@github.com/djangoplicity/djangoplicity-customsearch.git@develop

# Asynchronous Task Queue
celery==4.4.7
```
Celery is also required for some asynchronous tasks to work.

Now include the package in your [INSTALLED_APPS](test_project/settings.py#L31).

Djangoplicity requires some additional settings in order to work, so add [this](test_project/settings.py#L139) configuration to your settings
file (you don't have to include those files in your assets).

You can find more information about the required code in the [test_project](test_project) folder.

## Development

This repository includes an example project for local development located in the test_project folder. You can find
there the basic configuration to get a project working.
 
### Cloning the repository

In your terminal run the command:

```` 
git clone https://gitlab.com/djangoplicity/djangoplicity-customsearch.git
````

### Running the project

All the configuration to start the project is present in the docker-compose files and Dockerfile,
then at this point a single command is required to download all the dependencies and run the project:

```` 
docker-compose up
````

> The previous command reads the config from docker-compose.yml. 

When the process finishes, the server will be available at *`localhost:8002`*

To stop containers press `CTRL + C` in Windows or `âŒ˜ + C` in MacOS

If the dependencies change, you should recreate the docker images and start the containers again with this command:

```` 
docker-compose up --build
````

### Additional commands

Inside the `Makefile` there are multiple command shortcuts, they can be run in UNIX systems like this:

```
make <command-name>
```

E.g.

```
make test
```

> In Windows you can just copy and paste the related command
