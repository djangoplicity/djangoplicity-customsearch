Djangoplicity Customsearch is a dependency of the [Djangoplicity](https://github.com/djangoplicity/djangoplicity) CMS
created by the European Southern Observatory (ESO) for managing internal searches.

## Installation
Djangoplicity Customsearch actually supports Python 2.7 and Python 3+.

You must install Djangoplicity Customsearch using the Github repository, so add the following packages to your
requirements depending on the Python version you are using.
```
# For Python 3+
git+https://@github.com/djangoplicity/djangoplicity.git@release/python3

git+https://@github.com/djangoplicity/djangoplicity-customsearch.git@release/python3

# For Python 2.7
git+https://@github.com/djangoplicity/djangoplicity.git@develop

git+https://@github.com/djangoplicity/djangoplicity-customsearch.git@develop

# Asynchronous Task Queue
celery==4.4.7
```
Celery is also required for some asynchronous tasks to work.

Now include the package in your `INSTALLED_APPS`:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...,
    'djangoplicity.admincomments',
    'djangoplicity.customsearch',
]
```

Djangoplicity requires some additional settings in order to work, so add this configuration to your `settings.py` 
file (you don't have to include those files in your assets):
```python
# JAVASCRIPT CUSTOM CONFIG
JQUERY_JS = "jquery/jquery-1.11.1.min.js"
JQUERY_UI_JS = "jquery-ui-1.12.1/jquery-ui.min.js"
JQUERY_UI_CSS = "jquery-ui-1.12.1/jquery-ui.min.css"
DJANGOPLICITY_ADMIN_CSS = "djangoplicity/css/admin.css"
DJANGOPLICITY_ADMIN_JS = "djangoplicity/js/admin.js"
SUBJECT_CATEGORY_CSS = "djangoplicity/css/widgets.css"
```

Next, you have to register the models in your `admin.py` file.
```python
# Import all admin interfaces we need
import django.contrib.sites.admin
from djangoplicity.contrib.admin.discover import autoregister
from djangoplicity.contrib.admin.sites import AdminSite
import djangoplicity.customsearch.admin

# Register each applications admin interfaces with
# an admin site.
admin_site = AdminSite(name="admin_site")

autoregister(admin_site, django.contrib.auth.admin)
autoregister(admin_site, django.contrib.sites.admin)

autoregister(admin_site, djangoplicity.customsearch.admin)
admin_site.register(django.contrib.auth.models.User, django.contrib.auth.admin.UserAdmin)
admin_site.register(django.contrib.auth.models.Group, django.contrib.auth.admin.GroupAdmin)

```

## Development

This repository includes an example project for local development located in the test_project folder. You can find
there the basic configuration to get a project working.
 
### Cloning the repository

In your terminal run the command:

```` 
git clone https://gitlab.com/djangoplicity/djangoplicity-customsearch.git
````

### Running the project

All the configuration to start the project is present in the docker-compose files and Dockerfile,
then at this point a single command is required to download all the dependencies and run the project:

```` 
docker-compose up
````

> The previous command reads the config from docker-compose.yml. 

When the process finishes, the server will be available at *`localhost:8002`*

To stop containers press `CTRL + C` in Windows or `âŒ˜ + C` in MacOS

If the dependencies change, you should recreate the docker images and start the containers again with this command:

```` 
docker-compose up --build
````

### Additional commands

Inside the `Makefile` there are multiple command shortcuts, they can be run in UNIX systems like this:

```
make <command-name>
```

E.g.

```
make test
```

> In Windows you can just copy and paste the related command
